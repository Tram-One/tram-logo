## Summary

This logo was created for the Tram-One Project, it was designed by Daniel Jurman.
This version is built off of a single SVG. It uses svgexport to build png variants.

Additionally, you may import this as a javascript module. This will give you access to the png and svg files in your project

## Build Instructions

To build the logo images, and all variants, you'll need to serve the css assets, and then in a separate tab, run the build command. Once the build command has finished, you can kill the webserver.

```
npm ci
npm run serve
npm run build
```
